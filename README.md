# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

**Aim**
The aim of this project is to develop a database to analyze and visualize data on hotel booking for periods 2018-2020. To achieve this, some stakeholder questions listed below needs to be answered:
•	Is our hotel revenue growing by year?

•	Should the parking space be increased?

•	What are the important trends in the data?

**Approach**
1.	We will segment our revenue by hotel types which are two (resort and city hotels).

2.	Analysing the trend in guests with personal cars.

3.	Exploring seasonality by focusing on average daily rate and guests.

**Data Analysis Project Pipeline**
•	Build a database

•	Develop the SQL query
1.	The database has 3 tables (2018, 2019 & 2020), so I combined the three tables into a single database using the union operator.

•	Connect Power BI to the database

•	Visualize

•	Summarize findings
